# node_line


### Experimental plan:
1. NODE with and without line integral: see faster training and lower validation loss
2. Try on different dynamical systems (mass-spring damper, single pendulum, double pendulum)
3. Try to pretrain on line integrals vs adding as regularization
4. Separate models for direction and magnitude of the vector field
5. Vary noise levels and see the effect on the overall method
6. See the effect of using irregular time intervals
7. Use as a feature generator for classification
